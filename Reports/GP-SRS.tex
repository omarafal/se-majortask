\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The Software Requirement Specification Document (SRS) is to overview and outline the requirements of the Shoezone Website. The intended audiences are Dr. Essam Eliwa and Eng. Omar Magdy. Shoezone Website eases ordering for all Shoezone store clients of different ages and knowledge about websites; The website displays the available shoes in the store and allows the user to order using any internet browser as the website will adjust to the screen according to its size.
\subsection{Scope of this document}
The website helps Shoezone store clients buy whatever they want without the need to tire themselves to buy it from the store. The website is for Shoezone store owner Abdelrahman Gamal, and it is for the use of all store clients.
We already submitted the proposal document and the front-end,and we intend to finish the project during the next month, where the final deliverables are back-end, testing document, and SSD document.

\section{System Description}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Nowadays website developers are challenged on implementing the website before the competitor can issue his website, therefore the satisfaction of the users of e-commerce websites decreased, as most of the developers do not consider some obstacles that meet the user, for example, according to the American Management Association Survey in 1997, slow response time, lack of user friendliness, and poor website design. Furthermore, the clients are sometimes distracted by the website’s actions as the website does not give feedback for their actions. 
Anyways, we are planning to design a website that minimizes the number of clicks and the user will reach the page he wants. This is by locating the important data in the most places the users usually search in when they first open the website, for instance, in the upper left corner of the page or the upper part of the page generally, also we will keep the least important information at the bottom of the page, so it does not distract the user. In addition, we will consider designing a website that responds to the user’s interaction with the website. 


\subsection{System Overview}
Shoezone Website displays the available shoe in store using any browser for both men and women. It contains seperate pages for men and women to ease the search; In addition to, having a search bar in home page to help in finding a specific item. Shoezone also provides online ordering; Therefore, there is a cart page in which all the items to be ordered is added to, so the client can directly go form it to the checkout page to place his order.   

\subsection{System Scope}
The website is built to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Display all the available shoes and the available sizes
 \item Allow the clients to order through any available shoes.
 \item Inform the client of the estimated delivery time.
 \item Provides different types of payment like Cash, VISA, and American Express.   
 \item Maintains the clients' information to allow them to order again by logging into their accounts, so they will not need to fill in their information again.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Context}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Designing a user-friendly website with a fast response time.
 \item The user can shop from the store whatever they want in the comfort of their home.
 \item The design is privileged with clear navigations to help the clients with their orders.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ User Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Customers are not expected to comprehend a lot about computers; the only skill needed is to be capable of using computer software.
\item It is required from the admins to have minimum knowledge of database handling, as we are using Django, which already provides a user interface. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{System Functions}\label{System Functions}
\subsubsection{Admin}
The admin should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Have the ability to update the database.
\item Can keep track of clients orders status.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Client}
The Customer should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can sign up to creat an account.
\item Can directly sign in, if he/she already had created an account.
\item View shoes and available sizes.
\item Search for shoes.
\item Add and remove from the cart.
\item Place an order, and know the estimated delivery time.
\end{itemize}
\section{Design Constraints}
Shoezone website helps store customers view and order any shoes they want from their homes through a user-friendly website, thus they do not need to be physically in the store

\section{Operational Scenarios}
Initial Assumption: 
Normal: The customer views the shoes on the website if the customer decides to order any of the shoes; It will require him to sign up if it is his first time using the website or sign in using his account if the customer has one. Subsequently, he will add any shoes he wants to the cart to checkout and place the order.
What can go wrong:

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sign up with an existing email
\item The user enters a wrong password, while signing in
\end{itemize}
System state on completion: The user should be capable of viewing and searching for shoes before signing up or signing in if the user wanted to place an order then he/she should sign up or sign in
